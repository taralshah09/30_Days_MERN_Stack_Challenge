# 🚀 30 Days MERN Stack Challenge

Welcome to the **30 Days MERN Stack Challenge!** 🎯 A daily coding journey where I'm challenging myself to build 30 projects in 30 days using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This repo is a showcase of my progress, creativity, and learning as I take on this ambitious journey to become a proficient full-stack developer!

## 🌟 Why This Challenge?

This challenge is all about pushing my limits, learning new concepts, and honing my skills as a **MERN Stack Developer**. By building real-world projects every day, I aim to gain hands-on experience and solidify my understanding of the stack.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, CSS, Tailwind, Redux, Context API
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, JWT Authentication
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Tools:** VS Code, Postman, MongoDB Compass, Chrome DevTools

## 📚 Topics Covered

During this challenge, I will dive into a variety of core MERN Stack topics, including:

- **React:** Components, Hooks, State Management, Routing
- **Node & Express:** API Development, Middleware, Authentication, and Security
- **MongoDB:** Database Design, Mongoose Models, Data Handling
- **Authentication:** Implementing JWT, Cookies, and Secure User Authentication
- **UI/UX:** Crafting responsive designs and interactive user interfaces
- **Best Practices:** Code Structuring, Error Handling, and Deployment

## 💡 Project Ideas

Some of the projects that I plan to build during this challenge include:

1. **Task Tracker App:** Manage tasks with a clean UI and authentication.
2. **Recipe Finder:** Fetch recipes from an API with filtering options.
3. **E-Commerce Site:** Basic shopping platform with product listings and cart functionality.
4. **Weather Dashboard:** Live weather updates with beautiful UI components.
5. **Chat App:** Real-time messaging using WebSockets.
6. **Expense Tracker:** Track spending with visual data insights.

### 🚧 Progress So Far

- **Project 1:** Simple CRUD Based Book App
- **Project 2:** JWT Auth Based Todo App

Stay tuned as I continue to add more projects over the coming days!

## 🎯 Daily Learning Objectives

The goal is to cover a new topic or build a new feature each day, pushing forward with:

- **Days 1-10:** Focus on mastering CRUD, UI/UX design, and state management.
- **Days 11-20:** Dive into authentication, API development, and advanced routing.
- **Days 21-30:** Explore real-time features, performance optimization, and deployment.
